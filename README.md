# weather_project

Personal project in progress. Goal is to create a website that will pull weather information from an open api based on input from user.
This will include city, zipcode, and possibly location data.

Information will include current temperature and weather patterns for input location.

Will include animations for changes in information. Stretch goal for animations of static information.
